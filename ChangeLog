Version 2.0 (24 Oct 2016)
  * Introduced es from smooth package as core for MAPA. This can handle any seasonal length and allows some additional flexibility in model search. 
  * mapaest, mapa & mapasimple: the user can select to use either ets (forecast) or es (smooth).
  * Users can pass additional arguments to ets or es through ellipsis.
  * plotmapa: became obsolete, simply use plot().
  * Improved visualisation. Now using RColorBrewer.
  * mapacalc: the "output" input argument is removed.
  * mapasimple: the "output" input argument is removed.
  * mapasimple: simpified function wrapper.
  * Introduced S3methods.
  * smooth and RColorBrewer packages added to dependencies. 

Version 1.9.1 (24 May 2016)
  * Fixed bug introduced by changes in the initialisation of ETS when n < 3*s and seasonality (s) = 2. 
    The fix does not permit seasonal models in that case. If n >= 3*s seasonality is permitted. 

Version 1.9 (21 November 2014)
  * Corrected bug in mapafor when ifh == 0 and prediction intervals were requested.
  * Added more detailed package description.

Version 1.8 (03 October 2014)
  * Corrected bug for very short time series.

Version 1.7 (31 July 2014)
  * Added plotmapa function to visualise fitted MAPA without need to re-estimate
  * Removed dependence on 'miscTools' package for calculation of medians by columns
  * Corrections in .Rd files

Version 1.6 (03 July 2014)
  * Added non-overlapping temporal aggregation function (tsaggr).
  * Added URL info in description.
  * Corrected bug in mapaest when actual was constant (ets returned 
    different structure).

Version 1.5 (04 June 2014)
  * Added empirical prediction intervals for mapa and mapafor.
  * Added return to some functions that were missing it.
  * Plots in mapaest and mapafor re-initialise the plot figure.
  * Variable name insample replaced with y.
  * Added more help details for mapasimple and mapacalc outplot input.
  * Corrected bug in mapa that would not transfer model to mapaest.
  * Corrected bug in mapafor when ppy was equal to 1.
  * Corrected bug in mapasimple when fh was equal to 1. The bug was
    caused by the introduction of the model option in v1.4. 

Version 1.4 (13 May 2014)
  * Added model option for mapa, mapasimple and mapaest.

Version 1.3 (15 April 2014)
  * Corrected bug with minimumAL. Now minimumAL can be > 1.
  * Corrected ylim when outplot=2 for the component plots.
  * Added links to the help files. 
	
Version 1.2 (24 March 2014)
  * Stopped using forecast:::pegelsresid.C. New forecast package (v5.3) 
    allows keeping initial values constant.

Version 1.1 (Not in CRAN)
  * Switched from doSNOW to parallel.
  * Introduced NAMESPACE.
	
Version 1.0 (Not in CRAN)
  * Initial version.
